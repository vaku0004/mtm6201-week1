        <h1>Viktoria Vakulenko</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Viktoria, and I recently came to Canada to study Media Design. Before this, I worked as a manager at an advertising agency and observed the entire creative process that was taking place around me. We had a team of designers who created website layouts, a technical manager who handled the coding and hired contractors, a producer who was responsible for video production and filming, a creative director who came up with creative solutions, and a project manager who coordinated the work of all employees and communicated with clients. After seeing the entire process from the inside, I decided that I also wanted to try myself in the field of design and creative profession, which is why I'm here! I opted for the IMD program due to my interest in studying video editing, motion graphics, and UX design. At the beginning of the program, I had no prior knowledge of web development. However, as the course progressed, I became intrigued by this subject and also developed an interest in mobile application development.I hope that by the end of the program, I will be able to determine the suitable direction for myself and find an interesting job.</p>
